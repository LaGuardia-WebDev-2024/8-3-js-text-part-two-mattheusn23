Directions
Step #1 - Follow the mouse with the pink ball!
To start our mouse tracking program, make it so that the ellipse() shows up at the user's mouse position, instead of always being in the same position.

Hint: Use the mouseX and mouseY variables to position your ellipse.


Step #2 - Display the coordinates!
To make this tracker more useful, you're going to constantly display a label with the current x and y mouse coordinates next to the dot. To do that:

Add together mouseX, a string with a comma, and mouseY; Store as a variable
var label = XXXX + " , " + XXXXX;

Pass the variable into the text command and show it next to the ball.
text(label, XXXX, XXXX)


Step #3 - Add a feature!
Try to add one of the following extra features to this lesson:

Change Color Based on mouseX and mouseY Example Code
Change Font Example Code
